      <h2 id="about_me_grid" class="gol-header micro5">About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Artis Avoti≈Ü≈° and I'm a generalist with over 20 years of
        experience in the software industry. I have worked for companies of all
        sizes, from small startups to large corporations, and have been a
        founder as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technology stack of choice is Python or JavaScript for the backend,
        and React for the frontend. PostgreSQL is my preferred database. I have
        experience with Django, Flask, Express, Next.js, and DRF for backend
        development. For frontend, I work with React, Preact, or vanilla JS. I
        prefer TypeScript for all my JavaScript projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proficient in Linux and comfortable with the command line. My daily
        OS is either MacOS or Arch Linux. I prefer using Docker and Nix. I have
        been hosting my own services on a $5 VPS for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have worked as a contractor, an individual
        contributor, and I have spent two years as an engineering manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working with microcontrollers and have built a few fun projects
        with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's my professional life summed up in a few paragraphs. Feel free to
        look around the site to learn more about me.
