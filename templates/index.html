    <h1 class="lead">Hi, I'm Artis</h1>
    <p class="sublead">
      I am a software engineer and I love building things.<br />
      I work on backend, frontend, and DevOps.
    </p>
    <p class="sublead">Welcome to my website!</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a generalist with over 20 years of experience in the software
      industry. I have worked for companies of all sizes, from small startups to
      large corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technology stack of choice is Python or JavaScript for the backend, and
      React for the frontend. PostgreSQL is my preferred database. I have
      experience with Django, Flask, Express, and DRF for backend development.
      For frontend, I work with React, Preact, or vanilla JS. I prefer
      TypeScript for all my JavaScript projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proficient in Linux and comfortable with the command line. My daily
      OS is either macOS or Arch Linux. I prefer using Docker and Nix. I have
      been hosting my own services on a $5 VPS for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microcontrollers and embedded systems are my hobby. I once built an
      installation for the Riga City Festival that used Arduino, a custom LED
      driver, and a backend built with Flask and Redis to control the lights.
      People could tweet their messages or enter them into a local terminal, and
      the messages would be flashed using Morse code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I have been learning Rust and OCaml. This website runs on a Rust
      backend with my own implementation of Server Side Includes. The frontend
      is vanilla JS with no frameworks. The CSS is Sakura.css with a few
      customizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak English, Latvian, and Russian. In the past, I lived in the
      Netherlands and can understand some Dutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked as an individual contributor and have been an engineering
      manager as well. I enjoy programming and building things more than
      managing people.
    </p>

      Got a cool idea? Need help with your project? Looking to launch an MVP?
      I'm your guy. I'm available for contract work. Having spent two decades
      tinkering with code, I know a thing or two about building software.

    <p>
      I am from Latvia, a small country in the Baltics. Latvia is part of the EU
      and the Schengen zone.
